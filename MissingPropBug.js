This error occurs when you use a component that requires a specific prop, but you don't provide it.  This is especially common with components that expect a function as a prop, such as event handlers. For example, a button component may expect an `onPress` prop, but if you don't provide it, you'll get a warning or error in the console, and the button might not work as intended.  This can manifest in various ways depending on the component and how it handles missing props.
