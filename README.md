This repository demonstrates some less common scenarios where missing props in React Native can cause unexpected behavior.  The examples showcase situations beyond simple missing event handlers, including problems with complex prop types, default prop handling, and the interaction between props and state.  The solutions offer different approaches to prevent these errors and improve code robustness.
